            <p>Article 3: India Condoles Loss of Lives in Recent Attacks and Welcomes Release of Hostages by Hamas

In a show of solidarity and empathy, India has expressed its condolences on the tragic loss of lives in the recent attacks that took place on October 7. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) released a statement, extending heartfelt sympathies to all those affected by this senseless act of violence. 

The October 7 attacks, which claimed the lives of innocent civilians, have been met with outrage and condemnation from around the world. As the global community stands united in the fight against terrorism, India stands shoulder to shoulder with the nations affected by such heinous acts. 

In addition to expressing condolences, India also welcomed the recent release of some hostages by Hamas, a Palestinian militant group. The act of releasing hostages is viewed as a positive step towards peace and stability in the region. India firmly believes in the power of dialogue and negotiation to resolve conflicts and end the suffering of innocent people. 

The Ministry of External Affairs further reiterated India&#x27;s commitment to supporting all efforts aimed at countering terrorism and promoting peace in the Middle East. India has consistently condemned acts of violence and terrorism, and has called for collective action to eradicate this menace from society.

India, itself a victim of numerous terror attacks, understands the pain and trauma faced by those affected by such incidents. The nation has always stood in solidarity with other countries in their times of grief and has actively participated in international efforts to combat terrorism.

As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of terrorism, it is imperative for nations to come together to share information, intelligence, and expertise in order to prevent such tragedies from recurring. India, with its experience and expertise in counter-terrorism operations, is ready to extend its support to any nation in need.

The recent acts of violence serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for global cooperation in combating terrorism. It is only through collective efforts and a steadfast commitment to peace that we can create a safer world for future generations.

In conclusion, India extends its heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims who lost their lives in the October 7 attacks. The nation stands in solidarity with all those affected by this tragedy and calls for a united front in the fight against terrorism. India also commends the release of hostages by Hamas and encourages all parties involved to further engage in dialogue and peaceful negotiations to resolve conflicts. Together, let us strive towards a world free from violence and terror.</p>
